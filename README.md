The code of this directory calculates de fast Fourier transform (FFT). Re-expresses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an arbitrary composite size N = N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub> in terms of N<sub>1</sub> smaller DFTs of sizes N<sub>2</sub>, recursively, to reduce the computation time to O(N log N) .

DFT is a mathematical operation that is used to analyze the frequency of an audio signal and is represented as a set of complex coefficients. Each of these coefficients represents the intensity of a specific frequency in the audio signal.

The FFT is an efficient algorithm for calculating the DFT of an audio signal, and is faster than the algorithm of the classic Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). In the code you provided, the fft() method takes an audio signal (x) as input and returns the DFT of this signal as result.

 Fourier analysis is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer.
