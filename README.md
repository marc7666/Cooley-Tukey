# Cooley-Tukey

The code of this directory calculates de fast Fourier transform (FFT). Re-expresses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an arbitrary composite size N = N<sub>1</sub> N<sub>2</sub> in terms of N<sub>1</sub> smaller DFTs of sizes N<sub>2</sub>, recursively, to reduce the computation time to O(N log N) .

 Fourier analysis is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer.
